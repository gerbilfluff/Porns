DEAN SITS on a swivel-style CHAIR before a COMPUTER, HIS EYES STARING at the COMPUTER SCREEN. HE'S TYPING with angry keypunches. HANK STANDS to the LEFT of the chair DEAN's sitting in. HANK YAWNS.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>(DETERMINED) <BR><U>First</U> it was when Dad wouldn't let me send any bank information to those nice old ladies from Nigeria who were keen enough to wanna split their fortune with me. <BR><BR><BR>(DEAN SWIVELS HIS CHAIR to FACE HANK and HOLDS UP ONE HAND, TWO FINGERS RAISED.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR><U>Then</U> he made me take down my petition website for saving those poor elephants people were squashing into teeny little goldfish bowls and taking photos of, 'cause he said the pictures looked <U>faked</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(DEAN HOLDS UP HIS OTHER HAND, which is HOLDING a PRINTED-OFF IMAGE.)<BR><BR>(CUT to CLOSEUP of PRINTED-OFF IMAGE. HOLD THIS SHOT for a moment. A photo of an elephant has obviously been Photoshopped onto a picture of a fish tank; there's still some trim of background edges around the elephant.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>(OFFSCREEN)<BR>Does <U>this</U> look <U>fake</U>? <BR><BR><BR>(ZOOM OUT to WAIST-UP SHOT of DEAN. HE LOWERS HIS HAND.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>Elephants don't forget, Hank! And they're not gonna forgive stuff like this, <U>ever</U>! But then... <U>then</U>!! He turned my personal Interweb page into his <U>own</U> site! All my dancing smiley faces, the bunny rabbit picture that hopped back and forth under where my name was, those lawyer jokes I got from e-mails-- all <U>gone</U>! He made it a tribute page for William Shatner, and the stuff <U>I</U> was showing the world's disappeared <U>forever</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to MIDRANGE SHOT of HANK AND DEAN. HANK SHRUGS, HOLDING BOTH HIS PALMS OPEN TOWARDS DEAN as he does so.)<BR><BR><BR>HANK<BR>You could just make a new one. Wasn't your old one free anyhow?<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>(POUTY)<BR>That's not the <U>point</U>! Dad's pushed my Interweb pursuits around for too long... A guy can only take so much. You are looking at a Dean <U>scorned</U>, Hank! <BR><BR><BR>(DEAN NARROWS HIS EYES, LOOKING OFF IN THE DISTANCE solemnly.) <BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>And I just hope all those elephant angels up in heaven can forgive me for what I'm gonna do...<BR><BR><BR>HANK<BR><U>Gasp</U>! You're not gonna... send him pictures of naked ladies over his e-mail...?<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>No. Something <U>worse</U>.<BR><BR><BR>(DEAN SWIVELS HIS CHAIR back TOWARDS the COMPUTER and POINTS to the COMPUTER SCREEN. PAN UP to what we'll call the KISSING PICTURE: two barely-detailed stick figures with &quot;I [heart] the Monark&quot; and &quot;Love D[&quot;ea&quot; scribbled out, written over]R Venture&quot; written on it.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>I'm putting this picture I drew on his webpage... of him and the Monarch, <U>kissing</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(ZOOM OUT to include HANK. HE SQUINTS at the COMPUTER SCREEN.)<BR><BR><BR>HANK<BR>I dunno, Dean. You sure people are gonna believe Dad really did this?<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>Come on! Of <U>course</U> they will. It's called the &quot;<U>Information</U> Superhighway&quot; for a <U>reason</U>. Nobody lies about stuff there! <BR>(STONILY SERIOUS)<BR>Except <U>now</U>...<BR><BR><BR>(ZOOM IN on DEAN'S HAND CLICKING the COMPUTER MOUSE.)<BR><BR>(CUT TO CLOSE UP of BROWSER WINDOW; the KISSING PICTURE is loading on the top of Dr. Venture's website.)<BR><BR><BR>DEAN<BR>(OFFSCREEN)<BR>It's time to fight fire... with <U>cyberspace</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(OPENING TITLES)<BR><BR>(FADE IN to WIDE SHOT of PRISON VISITATION HALL - INT. - DAY. MONARCH SITS with HIS VISITATION PHONE IN HIS HAND, looking through the GLASS WALL at HENCHMAN 21 and HENCHMAN 24, who HOLD a SECOND VISITATION PHONE BETWEEN THEM on their side.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>Ah. My faithful henchmen... It seems like ages since I've gotten to see familiar faces of solace in this godforsaken place.<BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH PAUSES and NARROWS HIS EYES. HE PLACES ONE HAND [the one not holding the phone] FLAT on the TABLE, FINGERS SPLAYED.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>Did you bring the lotion?<BR><BR><BR>(ZOOM IN to a CLOSE SHOT of MONARCH. HE RAISES HIS HAND from the TABLE to WRING HIS FIST IN THE AIR, off in his own world for next line.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>It may seem redundant to smuggle in antibacterial rinses through the usual methods here... but I tell you, it is a <U>much</U> <U>needed</U> redundancy!<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to MIDRANGE SHOT of the TWO HENCHMEN. THEY BOTH SMILE.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 21<BR>No sir, we didn't. And after today, we won't have to anymore.<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>What?<BR>(SPUTTERS)<BR>What the [fuck] is this I'm hearing?! My own [fuck]ing henchmen, my hired flesh and blood, abandoning me? You bastards-- <U>traitors</U>! You'd [fuck]ing kick a two-legged puppy while it was trying to relieve itself, wouldn't you, you [shit]s--<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to HENCHMEN. HENCHMAN 24 WAVES HIS HANDS CLOSE TOGETHER and BACK AND FORTH BEFORE HIM.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 24<BR>No, no! Boss, it's not like that!<BR><BR><BR>(HENCHMAN 24 STOPS MOVING HIS HANDS and LOOKS to HENCHMAN 21.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 21<BR>See, watch! We fixed it! <BR><BR><BR>(ZOOM OUT as HENCHMAN 21 RAISES the TOY LIGHTSABER [from &quot;Tag Sale-- You're It!&quot;] WITH BOTH HANDS to eye-level and FLICKS THE TOY LIGHTSABER'S BEAM ON.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 21<BR>Number 46 found out how to make it work on inorganic material from this one site online!<BR><BR><BR>(PAN OVER TOWARDS MONARCH as HENCHMAN 21 SLICES A WIDE CIRCLE INTO the GLASS WALL with the TOY LIGHTSABER. MONARCH LOOKS SURPRISED and DROPS HIS VISITATION PHONE, but PUSHES BOTH HANDS AGAINST the clean-cut GLASS CIRCLE. HE SHOVES THE GLASS CIRCLE OUT from the GLASS WALL and JUMPS THROUGH the CIRCLE-SHAPED HOLE now in the GLASS WALL.)<BR><BR>(CUT to a MIDRANGE SHOT of TWO PRISON GUARDS GAWKING at the scene assumed to be happening nearby, OFFSCREEN.)<BR><BR><BR>GUARD 1<BR><U>Daaaaamn</U>! You see that?<BR><BR><BR>GUARD 2<BR>Yeah!<BR><BR><BR>(SHORT PAUSE. SFX: SCUFFLES AND RUNNING from OFFSCREEN.)<BR><BR><BR>GUARD 2<BR>A real working lightsaber! That is [fuck]ing <U>awesome</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(GUARD 3 POKES HIS HEAD ONSCREEN, LOOKING at GUARDS 1 &amp; 2. HE FROWNS.)<BR><BR><BR>GUARD 3<BR>Dude. You guys are <U>so</U> [fuck]ed.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to COCOON - INT. - DAY. MIDRANGE SHOT of MONARCH suited in his regular costume and STANDING BEFORE HIS THRONE, HIS ARMS AKIMBO. HE SITS DOWN upon the THRONE, then casually ADJUSTS the CROWN on HIS HEAD.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>Ahhh. It's <U>good</U> to be back. <BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH RESTS HIS HANDS TOGETHER by the fingertips.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>Where are the rest of my henchmen? Get them in here, I want to see them all again.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to CLOSE SHOT of TWO HENCHMEN STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 21<BR>Um. We're it.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to WIDE SHOT of THRONE ROOM. There's SIX HENCHMEN STANDING IN A HORIZONTAL ROW a ways IN FRONT OF the THRONE. SHORT PAUSE.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR><U>What</U>?! Where'd they all go?<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 6<BR>Well... 18, 27, 73, and the Twins left for their smoke break...<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to CLOSE SHOT of MONARCH.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>Oh.<BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH PAUSES, RAISING ONE EYEBROW.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>How long ago was that? Ten minutes? Thirty?<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 24<BR>(OFFSCREEN)<BR>Two weeks ago, I think. The rest, ahhhm... four or five weeks, maybe?<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>(DUMBFOUNDED)<BR>I didn't know they all smoked.<BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH'S SHOULDERS SAG DOWNWARDS.) <BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>(MUMBLING, SOUNDING HURT)<BR>Thought I taught them better than that.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to CLOSE SHOT of HENCHMAN 21.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 21<BR>Oh, they didn't. They just hadn't gone outside the place for, like, months, before. I think they got lost.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT back to MONARCH.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>(MUMBLED)<BR>Grrr. <U>Knew</U> I should've gone for putting the new Cocoon somewhere else than inside an active volcano... The rates were so <U>good</U>, though... Well, anyway.<BR><BR><BR>(HE TOSSES HIS HAND as if dismissing the thought, then speaks to the room once more.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>All of you, listen well, for I've learned much over my many months inside the malodorous maw of prison. There are things you just... come to realize, when each day finds you hiding behind an open-air toilet for hours at a time so some hulking behemoth in a jumpsuit doesn't see you and try bending you over...<BR>(MUTTERED) <BR>...again... <BR>(NORMAL)<BR>I mean, how many can really say they've seen the desperate, brain-clearing insights only given to someone forced to be terrified of every sinister, carnally-driven move of their fellow men?<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to WIDE SHOT of ALL HENCHMEN; NONE OF THEM MOVE. SHORT PAUSE, then ONE HENCHMAN RAISES HIS HAND.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 7<BR>...I was a Boy Scout for five years.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT back to MONARCH. HE WINCES.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR><U>Ew</U>...! <U>No</U>, I was speaking hypothetic-- oh, I didn't need to know that.<BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH recovers and RAISES ONE ARM, POINTING ONE FINGER UPWARDS dramatically.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>But, no. <BR><BR><BR>(HE LOWERS HIS ARM slightly to PLACE THAT HAND FLAT UPON HIS CHEST.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>I speak of the realization that there are things I've taken for granted for far too long. The loyalty and devotion given to me by my henchmen, for instance.<BR><BR><BR>(MONARCH LOWERS HIS ARM, LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDE for the next line.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>(QUIET MUTTER)<BR>The ones left, I guess.<BR>(NORMAL)<BR>And now, I must come to terms with what matters in life. Like...<BR><BR><BR>(HE CLASPS HIS HANDS TOGETHER, bringing them CLOSE TO HIS CHIN; HIS EYES LOOK SKYWARD.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>...companionship.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to MIDRANGE SHOT of 2 or 3 HENCHMEN.)<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 24<BR>Wooow. That's really great, boss.<BR><BR><BR>HENCHMAN 5<BR>(NEXT TO HENCHMAN 24)<BR>Yeah. I wasn't sure when I heard the news at first, but it's great you've finally come out about you and Doctor Venture... you know, being a couple--<BR><BR><BR>(QUICK PAN FOLLOWING HENCHMAN 5 as HE FALLS to the FLOOR, DEAD. A DART is STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD.)<BR><BR>(BLUR PAN over to MONARCH. HIS costume's WINGS are FLARED WIDE; HIS WHOLE BODY'S BRISTLING.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>(THROUGH GRITTED TEETH)<BR>You all have five minutes to cobble together what the <U>hell</U> this idiot was babbling about or you're joining him where you stand!!<BR><BR><BR>(QUICK SKULL/LOGO SPIRAL to COCOON COMPUTER TERMINAL - INT. - LOW LIGHT. Another HENCHMAN is SLUMPED OVER IN THEIR CHAIR, THREE DARTS STUCK IN THEIR BACK AND NECK. SLOW PAN to the next CHAIR over, where MONARCH SITS with his back to the camera, LOOKING at the COMPUTER SCREEN, then ZOOM OUT to include the COMPUTER SCREEN and remaining FOUR HENCHMEN. The COMPUTER SCREEN SHOWS a BROWSER WINDOW set to Dr. Venture's website, KISSING PICTURE at the top and all. The HENCHMEN STAND around the CHAIR that MONARCH'S sitting at. THEY all TREMBLE IN FEAR, LOOKING AWAY from MONARCH.)<BR><BR><BR>MONARCH<BR>So <U>this</U> is what my nemesis thinks he can get away with in my absence, eh? While the Monarch's away, the Venture will play to the crowd all sorts of filthy filthy <U>foul</U>--<BR>(GETTING ANGRIER, TALKING FASTER)<BR>--<U>horrible lies of wrong</U> about his and my respective <U>rectums</U>, <U>ehh</U>?! Well, he's sorely mistaken if he thinks he will escape my slandered <U>wrath</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(QUICK ZOOM OUT to MIDRANGE SHOT of MONARCH POSING, WRINGING HIS HANDS in the air.

HE WALKS INTO the BEDROOM a few steps farther, then STOPS.) <BR><BR>(CUT to BROCK'S POV-- DR. VENTURE is KNEELING on the BED, REACHING to FLUFF UP THE EDGES of his NECK PILLOW. HE'S SMILING unusually girlishly.)<BR><BR>(CUT back to BROCK. HE SQUINTS, looking suspicious.)<BR><BR>(CUT to MIDRANGE SHOT of DR. VENTURE.

There's been a lotta talk 'round the Guild of Calamitous Intent lately 'bout ya.<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to DR. VENTURE. HE ROLLS HIS EYES.)<BR><BR><BR>DR. VENTURE<BR>Oh, what is it <U>now</U>...<BR><BR><BR>BROCK<BR>(OFFSCREEN)<BR>'Bout a website you put up a little while ago.<BR><BR><BR>DR. VENTURE<BR>What, is <U>that</U> all? Tchh.

VENTURE on the BED in the BACKGROUND [to the RIGHT of BROCK].)<BR><BR><BR>BROCK<BR>Well, s'kind of a surprise for everybody. You don't seem the type that'd really go for... y'know.<BR><BR><BR>(BROCK LOOKS AWAY from DR. VENTURE.)<BR><BR><BR>BROCK<BR>Given his history 'n all.<BR><BR><BR>(DR. VENTURE SIGHS and CROSSES HIS ARMS. SLOW ZOOM IN TOWARDS DR. VENTURE over the next line until the camera has a CLOSE SHOT on DR. VENTURE, then HOLD CLOSE SHOT.)<BR><BR><BR>DR. VENTURE<BR>(ANNOYED)<BR>Look, I've been keeping the records I've had of him since I was in college. He may not have that great of a voice, and...<BR><BR><BR>(DR. VENTURE SHRUGS.)<BR><BR><BR>DR. VENTURE<BR>...Maybe he's not the most <U>likable</U> guy, okay. But if those cape-wearing goofballs down at the Guild really want to raise that much of a stink over the simple fact that somebody's sat through all those shirtless fight scenes he used to do, then they're even <U>more</U> in need of an actual <U>life</U> than I <U>thought</U>!<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to CLOSE SHOT of BROCK.

Hooker,&quot; but this is ridiculous.<BR><BR><BR>(DR. VENTURE REMOVES HIS GLASSES with one hand. HE REACHES over to the LEFT of the BED [the side closer to the balcony] with the ARM HOLDING HIS GLASSES to SET DOWN HIS GLASSES ON THE NIGHTSTAND, then RAISES HIS HAND enough to FLICK DOWN the SECOND OF TWO SWITCHES on a small LIGHTSWITCH PANEL [ABOVE HIS NIGHTSTAND/TV SET]. The LAMP LIGHT turns OFF.)<BR><BR>(PAN LEFT to the BALCONY WINDOWS, where a SHADOWED FIGURE with a noticeable CROWN SHAPE ATOP ITS HEAD NARROWS ITS EYES.

Some WIRING snakes BETWEEN the PHONE CHARGING DOCK and the VIDEO SCREEN. The combined machines look like they were fixed together from whatever parts were around; there's a ton of DUCT TAPE WRAPPED AROUND the WIRING.

BROCK'S LEFT EYE TWITCHES.)<BR><BR><BR>BROCK<BR>Yeah, whatever. <BR>(AS IF IGNORING THE COMMENT) <BR>So I was thinkin', maybe I should know if there's a right way to handle this, so I thought... maybe I should ask someone who'd know about that... kinda thing.<BR><BR><BR>(BROCK LOOKS AT where he'd assumedly see PETER standing. SHORT PAUSE.)<BR><BR><BR>BROCK<BR>I mean, you--<BR><BR><BR>(CUT to PETER, who INTERRUPTS BROCK'S LINE.)<BR><BR><BR>PETER<BR>Oh, not <U>this</U> again... Look. Brock.<BR><BR><BR>(PETER RUBS HIS FOREHEAD with HIS FREE HAND and SHAKES HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH.)<BR><BR><BR>PETER<BR>I don't know how people keep making this mistake. I mean, just 'cause a guy likes to dress up in pink, maybe wear some tights, and shares a place with another guy for a few years, all of a sudden everyone thinks I'm <U>gay</U>.
