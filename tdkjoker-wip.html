Names were pesky things. Apparently, in this big ol' world, you were only supposed to have one, and it had to last you your whole life. It dragged around behind you, getting bulkier and itchier every day people saw you wearing it, until you woke up one day to find your name strapping you down worse than any straightjacket (and oh, he <I>knew</I> straightjackets)-- until it became who you were <I>supposed</I> to be. <I>Sure, we know old so-and-so. He'd NEVER do something like that. Not in a million years.</I> And for something as important as a name, you weren't even allowed to pick what it <I>was</I>.<BR><BR>No, he liked to keep his options open. It wasn't that he <I>couldn't</I> remember what'd taught him to see the funny side of life. Far from it! He'd have names, hometowns, and alibis bobbing up in his stream of consciousness a few dozen times a day. Problem was, they all sounded just as good... He figured, why play favorites?<BR><BR>But how does that saying go? &quot;There're exceptions to every rule. Even that one.&quot; And oh, how true it was. No matter how many drivers' licenses, credit cards, home sweet homes, and neighbors with horrible timing he'd burn through on his jaunts from one identity to the next, there were a handful of quirks that <I>followed</I> him. Try as he might, he could never seem to shake them off with the rest of the shrapnel.<BR><BR>The face paint, for example. Sure, there was probably a story behind that one-- why he felt compelled to slather on some makeup before going out on the town. Always in the same patterns, too... If he was a weaker man, he could've probably made a fortune whoring his sob story out to the daytime talk shows by now.<BR><BR>But that would mean sticking to one story, wouldn't it? <I>Boo hoo, sniff, Mommy used to pretty me up before she got out the frying pan. My uncle had a thing for clowns, and I'd get lonely after those escaped giraffes ate my parents</I>. Talk about BORING. (Personally, he liked the version where he'd headbutted some circus freak in a bar fight, only to find out the guy was contagious. If nobody else was going to believe him on that one, it was their own loss.)<BR><BR>Oh, and purple! When it came to what to wear, he couldn't get enough of it. Poor, misunderstood purple... Way back when, a purple suit was the ultimate don't-mess-with-me badge. The only people considered important enough to have something 'eggplant' in their wardrobe at all were the guys in charge. <I>Kings</I>. You wore it nowadays, and folks just assumed you wanted to screw over your fellow man literally.<BR><BR>Then there was fire. Ah, fire... one of those perfect, unexplainable nuggets of nonsense the world snuck in to keep things interesting, the severed fingers in life's chili bowl-- like hearing some fourteen-chinned manatee in a tank top insist she wanted the <I>Diet</I> Coke with her super-sized fries, or how fish would shit their entire intestinal tract if you squeezed them <I>just</I> right. Fire never let him down; it made no sense, played no favorites. It made things transform. Made them disappear. Clung to things, grabbed them and loved them to <I>death...</I> at least, until it got bored and moved on. <BR><BR>Yes, he could identify with fire. And in a place like Gotham, where the whole city lived, marched, and died to the drumbeat whims of little green pieces of paper-- paper that was so very, very <I>flammable</I>... gosh, it was a wonder he found time for a hobby at all!<BR><BR>And speaking of hobbies, no matter who he was from one day to the next, he could never stay away from the personals ads for long. Who could blame him? All those nameless, faceless dead-end souls, piled together like a catalog for captive audiences. Calling, nay, <I>screaming</I> to him from the newspapers and Craigslists and ad-rag kiosks on every street corner. Begging him to show them a little song, a little dance, a little bump-and-grope distraction from the fact that each and every one of them was going to die alone and afraid. The only place you'd find people more willing to bare their darkest, most dickcheese-curdling secrets to another human being was over in Arkham, and from what <I>he'd</I> heard, the padded rooms there weren't nearly as comfy as the brochures claimed.<BR><BR>-----<BR><BR><B><I>LOOKING FOR AN ADVENTURE</I></B><I> SBiWM ISO new thrills. 35yo 190lb 5'8&quot; bla/blu.

It was the <I>smell</I>; so strong, so many flavors of putrid, that he jerked back in an instinctual full-body flinch, slamming his apartment door shut in his own face. <BR><BR>Once he was done coughing, he grabbed the cluster-spray of keys still swaying from the door lock, if for no other reason than to stop it from jangling. Brad paused, staring at the doorknob... then at the back of his hand, closing over the knob. With the noise from his keys silenced, he could hear Orff's <I>O Fortuna</I> booming like a string-and-choral thundercloud on the other side of the door. <BR><BR>A prickly unease washed over him, but before he could collect his thoughts, his hand turned the knob. There he was, just like any other day, stepping into his apartment...<BR><BR>Right into the war zone.<BR><BR>He could barely recognize the sight before him as his living room. The fake crystal chandelier hung askew on its ceiling cord, all but two of its lights cracked and dark. The pristine cream-colored carpeting he'd spot-checked with his vacuum cleaner before heading to work was nowhere to be found, buried beneath an ankle-deep hurricane's trail of garbage. Catbox litter, old diapers... When he saw the flies swirling over an unrecognizable slurry of animal organs, he forced himself to look away, yanking his tie loose at the collar as he did so. He was going to have a fit, he knew it. Already, he could feel his pulse hammering in his throa-- <I>oh god his paintings</I>. Someone had drawn smiley faces over his original Francis Bacon. <I>SMILEY FACES</I>.<BR><BR>His eyes spun, trying to land on something that wouldn't send him into a conniption. Nothing helped. There were pizza boxes propped open along the shelves of his TV cabinet, gaping like rows of cardboard snake jaws. Soda cans covered in grime bled dark puddles of purple and orange down his sofa.<BR><BR>There was <I>a man</I> on his sofa.<BR><BR>Brad blinked, hoping he'd hallucinated that last part on account of the stench making his eyes water. But no, the stranger was still there, legs kicked up on the coffee-table-slash-compost-heap, swishing what looked like chocolate syrup around in one of Brad's brandy snifters. His face was caked over in white, like an old-time minstrel singer in reverse, probably thanks to the sack of flour upended on the couch cushions next to him. With his threadbare suit-- a paisley pea-soup-yellow blazer over lavender pinstripes, the kind of color mismatch that could get a used car salesman gagging-- he blended in with the rest of the room perfectly; a rotting chameleon.<BR><BR>The stranger raised the glass to his lips... which were outlined in bloody red smears, Brad noticed. Not just that, but they kept <I>going</I>, arching far past the point where lips were supposed to stop, much like the charcoal insomnia-lines scribbled around his eyes; <I>what's black and white and red all over</I>, Brad's mind spat back helplessly-- and took a long sip. Licking his lips, he turned to Brad and flashed him a chipper, syrup-brown grin.<BR><BR>&quot;Hi!&quot; he said.<BR><BR>Brad gaped at him. &quot;What - <I>IS - this?!</I>&quot; he sputtered, gesturing wildly enough at the room for his briefcase to drop and clatter into an island of beer bottles.<BR><BR>The man seemed hurt. &quot;That's it?&quot; he asked. His lower lip puffed out, giving Brad a ruby-red tremble. &quot;No 'hi, honey, how are <I>you,</I> how was work today,' nothing? Wow.&quot; <BR><BR>And just like that, his pout vanished. He took another swig of chocolate, then raised the snifter towards Brad. &quot;Well, uh. Let's see...&quot; he began, lifting his pinky and ring fingers from the stem to gesture about the room, point by point. &quot;The chicken livers, I found in the dumpster behind a charming little deli on Fourth Avenue. The <I>coffee grounds</I> were from the Betty's Pies next door... Then I dropped by the old Rocket Burger down the street from here, and I swear, I don't know <I>who's</I> been throwing away all those dead pigeons.&quot; He stretched his back against the sofa cushions with a guttural, alley-cattish sigh, sending an taco wrapper fluttering, and remarked, &quot;Goes well with the new bedroom decor, though, don't you think?&quot;<BR><BR>A pause. Once the thought finally connected, Brad lurched into motion, crunch-stepping his way past an overturned crate of syringes through the first doorway to his right. He flicked the lightswitch on.<BR><BR>And he stood there.<BR><BR>&quot;Is-- is that <I>ink?!</I>&quot; he wailed.<BR><BR>&quot;I <I>know!</I> Isn't it great?&quot; came the stranger's voice. &quot;I wasn't even planning on it, but I got to your computer room, and...&quot; The man trailed off in a wheezy chuckle. &quot;Well, what can I <I>say?</I> I've never seen anyone line up their printer cartridges by factory number before!&quot;<BR><BR>Brad said nothing. His gaze was still frozen on his bureau drawer.<BR><BR>&quot;Hel-<I>LO?</I>&quot; That voice again. &quot;...Okay. Look. If you're mad about the urine, I'm sorry, all right? Spur of the moment thing. I was 'in the zone,' as the kids say. All those... creative juices, getting stirred up... Y'know how it goes.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;You ruined my sock drawer,&quot; mumbled Brad under his breath.<BR><BR>The living room kept talking. &quot;Just think of it as an artist's signature!&quot;<BR><BR>Brad said it again, whispering this time, as he watched himself rummage for the locked metal box he kept under the bed.<I> &quot;You... you RUINED...&quot;</I> He spun the dials. Heard the latches open. <I>Crack, snap</I>. He could feel the sweat on his forehead rolling into his goatee. Dotting onto the shoulders of his business suit. Like his head was a little raincloud.<BR><BR>Pulling the pistol out of the case, now. Checking to see-- yes, the bullets were still in there. Brad got to his feet. Walked out of the bedroom. Held up the pistol to the thing sitting on what used to be his couch. He heard himself roaring at it: YOU <I>RUINED</I> MY <I>SOCK DRAWER</I>.<BR><BR>The stranger rolled his eyes and sighed, frowning at Brad through the drawn-on grin. As though he got guns aimed at his head several times a day. <BR><BR>&quot;You don't want to do that,&quot; he said simply.<BR><BR>Brad coughed, in an unsteady way that made it sound more like a laugh. His voice returned, sounding tiny against his panting: &quot;Wh-what.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I'm <I>saying</I> it's a bad idea.&quot; The man squirmed where he sat, shifting towards a better face-to-face view. &quot;You see...&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;Don't move!&quot; Brad yelled. The gun jerked forward from the force of his shout.<BR><BR>Without another word, the intruder lifted both palms flat in a cease-fire. The snifter dropped to the floor, spraying chocolate syrup across the carpet. <I>T-tmp</I>.<BR><BR>&quot;<I>AAH</I> I said<I> don't move!!</I> See, you ruined THAT, too, you ruined EVERY--&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Oh, put the gun down, will you? You're not fooling anyone,&quot; the man interrupted. He sounded annoyed. &quot;Swanky place like this? One shot, and in five minutes, the whole block'll be crawling with cops. What are you going to tell them? 'Officer, this guy made my room all <I>messy?'</I> For all they know, your apartment just looks like this.&quot;<BR><BR>Brad stood stock-still, shivering. &quot;So... but, then it'd be self-defense! I, I could...&quot;<BR><BR>The stranger glared at him. &quot;Give me the gun,&quot; he commanded.<BR><BR>Brad relaxed his grip around the pistol, then gave an empty gulp and squeezed hold of it again.<BR><BR>Those eyes. God, it was like staring into two stone coals.<BR><BR><I>&quot;GIVE IT!&quot;</I> roared the man.<BR><BR>Brad handed over the pistol. Even bowed his head a little as he did it.<BR><BR>&quot;Ah,&quot; the stranger said, looking vaguely surprised. With a smile, he slipped the gun into the hidden depths of his blazer. &quot;Huh. S'amazing, how often that works.&quot;<BR><BR>That was it. Brad's mouth opened, but there seemed to be nothing he could say, save for softly hyperventilating the garbage fumes in and out. So that's what he did. He let his eyes close, and just... swayed there.<BR><BR>It was in that pocket of silence that Brad realized his stereo was already partway through one of his relaxation CDs. Rainforest sounds. Strange... he'd never associated the rainforest with the overwhelming urge to murder someone before.<BR><BR>He could smell chocolate. Chocolate, if chocolate could go rancid. And it was warm, like... breathing.<BR><BR>His whole body clenched at the chuckle that puffed against his ear. The stranger was right there. Talking to him. &quot;OCD case, right? Mm... tough break. Tried it a couple times, myself.&quot; <BR><BR>Brad felt fingers smoothing through the rigid comb-grooves in his hair. He felt faint, barely able to hear the stranger's words... Damn it, he hadn't had the urge to bolt to the sink and start scrubbing in years, but this grungy maniac was <I>raping his head</I>. &quot;I hope you realize I'm not kidding when I say this, too: that sock drawer of yours was a bone. fide. <I>GEM</I>. I mean, the index cards? <I>Color-coded</I> index cards? And the way you had 'em folded up in spirals like that, all counter-clockwise? Wow, I-- ha ha, I felt <I>bad!</I> I really did! And you don't know me, I know, but... trust me, that's not something I feel too often!&quot;<BR><BR>The first sob finally burst its way out from Brad's throat. His eyes were squeezed shut so tight, his forehead was a maze of pulsing red. He wanted to punch this freak. Shove him. Kick him to the ground, and keep kicking, until the flies he'd let into the apartment would <I>really</I> have something rotten to nest in. And Brad knew he couldn't, because that would mean having to <I>touch</I> him.<BR><BR>&quot;...Yeah, see. This here's the trouble with <I>your</I> flavor of crazy,&quot; the stranger remarked. &quot;When you get right down to it, there's no challenge. All someone's gotta do is shuffle around the books on your shelf, and-- <I>ah! AAA!!</I>&quot; he shrieked, swishing his arms about in a perfect falsetto pantomime of the businessman trembling in front of him. &quot;Boom. Game's over, you're done. And suddenly, all those other problems life tosses your way?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Can't get that same rise out of you anymore. And we're talking <I>little</I> stuff, like... 'who <I>is</I> this--&quot; His hand turned cartwheels in the air as he searched for a word, then slunk to rest around Brad's shoulder instead, like an afterthought-- &quot;...this <I>weirdo</I>, with his revolutionary ideas in interior decorating?' Or even, 'I wonder how many <I>sharp things</I> he has tucked away in that snazzy outfit of his?'&quot;<BR><BR>Brad felt a rush of air under his left ear. <I>Fwik.</I><BR><BR>He opened his eyes. Leaned back, to see the switchblade jutting out from the man's fist. He blinked at it numbly. <BR><BR><I>This is bad</I>, his brain managed through its meltdown. <I>What is it you're supposed to say when you're getting robbed?</I><BR><BR>&quot;If... you're after money, I can, uh. Pay you.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Oh, for--! Not <I>you</I>, too.&quot; The man reared away from him, insulted. &quot;Why does everyone think I want<I> money?</I> Do I <I>look</I> like I spend my day checking stock portfolios?&quot; He looked Brad up and down with a sneer, then sent one hand rooting through his own blazer pockets.<BR><BR>The wad of bills he pulled out made even Brad's eyes widen. &quot;I've got <I>plenty</I> of money, I-- see, look at this! I don't know what to <I>do</I> with it all!&quot; Noting the businessman's trance, he held the paper crumples up to Brad's face, close enough to elicit a flinch. &quot;Ooh, pretty, yes. Munny munny munny!&quot; he said, and shook them, singing, &quot;Look at me, I'm a bunch of dead white guys on some paper! I get people to do all <I>kinds</I> of things! That's all I'm good for, 'cause I <I>never</I> ever change! I'm no fun <I>at ALL!</I>&quot; He finished with a gigantic, spittle-volleying raspberry that made Brad cough and sift frantically through his goatee, then returned the money to its paisley storehold. &quot;<I>No</I> no no. I'm only here 'cause I'm your nine o' clock. Thought I'd drop by early, tidy the place up a little.&quot;<BR><BR>Brad's fingers froze in mid-beardcomb. &quot;My-- nine...?&quot; he repeated, his expression blank.<BR><BR>&quot;Ah. Got that here somewhere, too,&quot; the man replied, patting down his pockets on the other side. He fished out a small newsprint rectangle, torn around the edges and surrounded by lopsided red marker circles. <I>&quot;And</I> I quote. Ah-<I>hem</I>. 'Looking for an <I>adventure!</I>' All capital letters, so I guess you really meant it. 'Essbee woom eye-so new thrills. Thirty-five, yo.'&quot; He winced at the paper, clucking his tongue. &quot;And the teachers said <I>my</I> spelling was awful.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What? You were the--?! No! N-<I>no!</I>&quot; The rage flooded back to Brad's face, even if his sputtering made it clear he hadn't the slightest clue what to do with it. &quot;That was for <I>sex</I>, you idiot! SEX!!&quot;<BR><BR>There it was again-- that raccoon-ringed, kicked-puppy Hurt Face. The man's mouth opened in a perfect <I>oh-shit</I> gasp, then snapped shut. Frowning at Brad, he huffed, &quot;<I>Well!</I> I can see how there might be some misunderstanding going on here, but... honestly, how is this <I>my</I> fault? You should've been more specific!&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;<I>I</I> should've--?!&quot; Brad echoed. He slumped against the back of his couch. Shielded his face with his hands. A snickering chuckle leaked out from between his fingers to join with the sweat and tears already there. Once the laughter started, he couldn't get it to stop; soon, he was gasping and braying like a donkey.<BR><BR>&quot;D'aww, shucks,&quot; the stranger drawled. &quot;Guys with a sense of humor... always been my weak spot.&quot;<BR><BR>A tug on his shirtcuff, and Brad looked up, choking out the tail end of a cackle. The maniac was sweeping the trash off the sofa cushions with one arm, leaving only flour and a few neon Cheeto-dust skidmarks behind. &quot;C'mon. Siddown,&quot; he said, beckoning to Brad with a curved fist. The one not wielding the knife. &quot;You look like you're having a long day.&quot;<BR><BR>What else was there to do? Brad rounded the side of the couch and took a seat, head sagging to rest upon crossed arms and stiff knees. Panting. Folded over. Already, his sides were punishing him for that laugh.<BR><BR>&quot;There we go,&quot; the man purred, patting his shoulder-- until Brad jerked away. &quot;Whoa...! Ha, ha. Still touchy. Well, don't worry, all right? Since it's all about <I>sex</I> with you... which, by the way, between friends? I'd get that checked out.&quot; He reached into his tacky yellow blazer once more, pinching clump after clump of bills free from his pockets. As they fluttered to the couch, he explained, &quot;I... will give you... every dollar on me right now, which... there. That's <I>more</I> than enough to get this place cleaned up again. Not even illegal-immigrant kind of service, either. <I>Real</I> clean. <I>IF </I>you help me work off a little steam before I go.&quot;<BR><BR>Ah-<I>ha. Now</I> he had his host's attention. The man tossed his hands to either side, adding, &quot;Or I can take off right now. All up to you. ...'Course, I'd take the moola <I>with</I> me in that case, but if you can't <I>stand</I> the idea of slobbering over a ladykiller like me...&quot; He smoothed his sweat-crusty brown hair back with his palms and swished his tongue across his upper lip. Somehow, it made the wink that followed even more disquieting. &quot;I promise I won't take it personally. Some folks just can't handle this kind of beautiful. But either way, just give me the 'yay' or 'nay,' and I'll be out of your life, like...&quot; He paused, then inched his foot over to kick a half-empty pineapple tin loose from the coffee table mound nearby. A banana peel and two styrofoam cups slumped to the ground along with it. <BR><BR>He let go of his hair and grinned at Brad, suddenly inspired. &quot;...Like a spring breeze!&quot;<BR><BR>Brad's eyes weren't there to meet his. Instead, the businessman seemed transfixed by the money scattered between the two of them. He wiped the sweat from his brow... Even now, when he was too dazed to try counting it, a simple glance told Brad that the kook wasn't lying. Not about this, at least; there was certainly a lot there. And if it meant he'd leave... &quot;I... I, don't know. Maybe?&quot; he stammered. &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<BR><BR>The man smirked at him. &quot;Well, between you and me...&quot; He slid his legs wider apart. Slunk a hand across the crotch of his trousers-- those stupid, <I>awful</I> purple pinstriped trousers. &quot;I've never been one to turn down a good facefuck, if someone's offering.&quot;<BR><BR>For some reason, Brad felt relieved. &quot;You want... a blowjob?&quot; he asked. &quot;That's it?&quot; <BR><BR>He found himself chuckling lightly as he slipped down to the floor from the cushions, still careful to keep from mashing as much of the trash under his knees as he could. &quot;And after that, you'll leave. Y-yeah, I can do that. Here, I-- I've got a...&quot; He dipped into his back pocket, fumbling for the condom there. Hell of a way for it to finally come in handy, but he <I>knew</I> it'd been a good idea to start carrying one around. <BR><BR>[Joker catches his hands around the sides of Brad's face, startling him just as he's about to hand over the square; Brad realizes those lipstick lines weren't lipstick, no, they were cut into his mouth; He realized that his head was trapped where it was, and the knife was still in the maniac's hand, and... and all of a sudden, the stereo whirred, discs gliding softly through the randomizer's motions until the strains of a Raffi album filled the air, cheery hand-strummed guitar and all. <I>Ah, that's right</I>... the CD he got for his sister's daughter, back when she wasn't some black-eyed stranger off in high school-- hell, when she couldn't even walk yet. When she was little and stupid enough to <I>like</I> cloying folksy tunes.<BR><BR>His niece's favorite song was from some Broadway play, now. It surprised Brad that the first thoughts to pop into his head would be so pointless, here while staring certain death-after-blowjob in the face.<BR><BR>The man peered closer, squinting to investigate the slim, greyhound-firm valleys of skin that ridged down from the peak of the businessman's nose, clammy with sweat as it all was. <BR><BR>&quot;You know,&quot; he remarked to Brad, &quot;I've always wanted to try it up the nose.&quot;<BR><BR>[&quot;See, the way <I>I</I> figure, it'd be just as rewarding being on the receiving end.

As soon as he could feel his jaw again, he growled, &quot;Those are my <I>parents</I>, you fuckhead!&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; the man in the clown makeup said, bobbing his head to the side; his eyes searched the ceiling tiles, as though his next line was written on one of them. &quot;Going by how well you're taking this whole situation, I'm gonna go ahead and guess you weren't particularly attached.&quot;<BR><BR>A low scoff from Fido. &quot;What makes you say that?&quot;<BR><BR>Clown Guy flailed his arms. &quot;Pfft!-- <I>I</I> don't know, maybe... the fact that you didn't hear them <I>screaming</I> down in the living room? That, that you were so busy playing your computer game, it took a chair leg to the head to get you to notice anything past your headphones? Or-- heh! That you can even <I>talk</I> right now, for that matter.&quot; He flicked his tongue over a smirk, just the tip, like some might clear their throat. &quot;See, maybe it's got something to do with all the collars and plastic dicks with dog tails on the end you've got stacked up in your closet, but... most folks, you kill their parents? And, and, show them the bodies?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;You're lucky to get words out of them at all. Unless, of course, there was some kind of a gulf between you and dear old Mom and Dad to begin with.&quot;<BR><BR>Fido's face remained solemn. &quot;We... weren't close,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I don't think they understood that much about me. Sure didn't <I>approve</I> of any of it, I know that.&quot; His lip curled into a snarl. &quot;But they were my <I>parents</I>. They fed me, kept a roof over my head... For a couple of humans, they were good people. <I>Really</I> good.&quot; He bobbed his head towards the table. &quot;And they deserved better than<I> that!</I>&quot;<BR><BR>At first, Clown Guy was silent. He raised a blood-darkened glove to his mouth. <BR><BR>&quot;A couple of...?&quot; he asked. &quot;Heh. Eheh. <I>Ha</I> ha ha-- I <I>did</I> hear you right, right?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;A couple of <I>humans</I>, yes,&quot; said Fido, rolling his eyes. &quot;See, I wouldn't expect you to know this, <I>or</I> understand, but if you've got me tied up and you're going to kill me anyhow, you might as well know. I'm a dog. I was born in the wrong body. <I>And</I> I'm attracted to other trans-species males. I've known it for years.&quot; He fixed Clown Guy with a steely glare. &quot;And the <I>reason</I> I spend so much time online is because there's others there who're like me, who GET me. <I>They</I> know what it's like-- living in a world full of humans who hate us, just 'cause we were born different!&quot;<BR><BR>The green-haired man stared at Fido. <BR><BR>Grinned at him, wide and sharp.<BR><BR>And he laughed.<BR><BR>Nothing malicious. No villain's cackle. Just something you'd hear on a Saturday night out with the guys, when somebody's told a great joke. At least, that's what Fido always imagined it would sound like; he'd never had that many friends.<BR><BR>The clown's chuckling died down. &quot;H-<I>hate</I> you? Are you <I>kidding?</I>&quot; He dug a gloved knuckle against his eyes to blot away a tear, adding a few new greasepaint streaks to the leather in the process. As he struggled to catch his breath, he said, &quot;Oh, I <I>knew</I> you were going to be a fun one. Maybe it was all those... smile things, you kept putting in, but as soon as I saw your ad...&quot; He tapped two fingers to his forehead, caking his glove powder-white there as well, and mouthed, <I>Knew it</I>.<BR><BR>Fido jerked to attention. His face wrinkled in disbelief. &quot;My <I>ad?</I> You came here to kill me 'cause of some stupid Internet ad?!&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Wull <I>yeah</I>, that was the <I>thought</I>,&quot; said Clown Guy, tipping his shoulders in matter-of-fact dismissal. &quot;I mean, if you weren't up to par, I brought along a little something to send you out Old Yeller style, but...&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Wh-what kind of a--?&quot; Fido interrupted, and stopped short, lost within the start of a shuddering, red-faced snit. &quot;Why'd you pick <I>me</I>, huh? Is it 'cause I'm gay, or because I'm a dog?&quot;<BR><BR>Clown Guy raised a finger and dabbed it in the air, like a drunken band conductor. &quot;Ah-<I>ha.</I> <I>Therrre</I> you go again. Assuming I'm holding that against you. 'Cause, listen... don't go passing it around, but...&quot; He trailed off, casting a suspicious glance over his shoulder at the two corpses. Narrowing his eyes, he leaned in close and whispered, &quot;I, uh. I used to be... a <I>god</I>, once.&quot;<BR><BR>No response from Fido, save a tighter frown.<BR><BR>The man shrugged. &quot;I mean, it didn't work out, obviously. But, there you go.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Don't patronize me!&quot; Fido barked.<BR><BR>&quot;Patro--?! Wha? How is that<I> patronizing?&quot;</I> The clown slumped away, his scarred lips flapping in a huff. &quot;Boy. And here I thought, of all peop... whoops. Of all, what was it, human bodied CRITTERS, <I>you</I> could relate.&quot;<BR><BR>And with that, his attention seemed to drift. He raised his butterfly knife to catch one of the stripes of setting sunlight through the miniblinds, sending a tiny prism-fleck flickering across the kitchen as he dangled the blade this way and that. &quot;You ever hear of the Aztecs?&quot; he asked.<BR><BR>A spark of recognition crossed Fido's eyes, despite himself. &quot;From... Peru?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Ooh.&quot; The man sucked in a hiss through his teeth. &quot;<I>Mexico</I>. So close.&quot; He flipped the knife around and bopped Fido on the head with the handle. &quot;Bad dog. ...Although, to be fair, most pooches'll run after live grenades if you throw 'em, so I think you're still ahead of the curve.&quot; He paused. Raised the blade-edge to itch idly under his chin. &quot;No, no... the Aztecs, see, they used to <I>eat</I> dogs. You know, those little yappy ones rich chicks carry around so they can crap in their purses? They'd fry 'em up on a stick. Like marshmallows.&quot; <BR><BR>His eyes locked with Fido's. Never blinking. &quot;Ever hear the sounds animals'll make when they're on fire? Or people, for that matter. Always gets me, how much they <I>sizzle</I>. It's all the fat on 'em, you see.&quot; With a wet smack of his lips, he added, &quot;Big ol' cuddle mutt like you, doesn't look like they walked ya too often... I'm willing to bet you'd be sparking for <I>hours</I>.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What does this have to do with you being a god?&quot; asked Fido flatly.<BR><BR>The clown-faced man's gleeful expression fizzled like a leaky balloon. &quot;You are <I>awfully</I> nonchalant about this 'getting killed' thing, you know.&quot;<BR><BR>Fido shrugged against his bindings. &quot;I'm twenty-two, in human years,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been leeching off my parents since I dropped out of college. Never had a job. I'm an embarrassment to anyone who gets too close to me. I've never seen any of my friends, past some words on a computer screen. And yesterday, I downloaded a video of some guy getting his head sawed off with a machete.&quot; He raised an eyebrow. &quot;I've thought about dying before. A lot.&quot;<BR><BR>Clown Guy nodded faintly. &quot;Huh. Yeah, fair enough,&quot; he replied, and swung his arms together for a flat-palmed clap. &quot;Right. So, as I was saying. Aztecs... Now, I'm sure you can't tell from the looks of me, but once upon a time, I used to be one of those <I>street crazies</I>. Something about the words 'severe, persistent schizophrenia' just doesn't get employers salivating over ya, I guess.&quot; <BR><BR>He spread his hands before him, fidgeting stray outlines in the air to set the scene. &quot;But one day, I'm catching a little store-window prime time, and there's a special on about these Aztec fellas. And let me tell you, anything you've heard about Mister Big-G God? The plagues, the floods, all that Old Testament stuff?&quot; He tossed his head, sending a wave of greasy green hair spasming. &quot;He's got nothing. <I>NOTH-ING</I>. on Aztec gods. They needed full-scale slaughter to get <I>anything</I> done! Like, you want the sun to keep coming up in the morning? That'll be a heart ripped out of some guy's chest, every day. Oh-- and it's gotta be <I>while he's still alive</I>. Want to make your plants grow? The god for that needed somebody's skin flayed off. Then they'd pick somebody to <I>become</I> that god, and <I>that</I> poor sap'd have to run around town wearing the skin as his new set of clothes, until it rotted off of him-- and by then, presto! It'd be spring.<BR><BR>&quot;So I'm watching this, and I'm thinking to myself, right? About how maybe <I>that's</I> why nothing's seemed to work out for me so far. I've just been setting my career options way too low!&quot;<BR><BR>Out went Clown Guy's hand again, like he was announcing a carnival act. &quot;And that's when they bring up their rain god... <I>Tlaloc</I>. Now, <I>this</I> guy was serious business. Great big black circles for his eyes. <I>Huge</I> red mouth. He could drown anyone he wanted. Make whole cities die from drought, if he felt like it. Lightning bolts, the works! And the only way to keep him happy was, you had to feed him BABIES!&quot; Clown Guy shook his head; his eyes shone with awe. &quot;They'd take <I>babies</I> and throw 'em in the river to make it rain! <I>Dozens</I> of 'em-- they'd make a whole event out of it! How hardcore can you <I>get</I>, huh?&quot;<BR><BR>Fido raised a 'hmph.' &quot;There's worse on the Internet,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>...And screeched, as the butterfly knife swooped across his gut. A hot red line sagged open between the folds, gaping like a bloody smile.<BR><BR>Clown Guy spun the knife around in his hand, ignoring both Fido's screams and the speckle-chains the motion sent twirling across his wrist. &quot;I. Wasn't. <I>Fin</I>-ished yet,&quot; he grumbled. His other hand went for Fido's hair, twisting hold of a bloody fistful and slamming Fido face-first against the kitchen tiles. &quot;<I>BAD dog!</I>&quot; <BR><BR>[words: he tells the rest of his story, how he made it rain one day, and was living the high life as Rain God until some teenagers cornered him and told him that if he's a <I>god</I>, he shouldn't have to be so uptight all the time. Should stop being so SERIOUS... &quot;You see? It doesn't matter if you're a god or a dog. <I>No</I>. body. <I>cares</I>.&quot;; cuts Fido's bindings and puts the kitchen phone down in front of him, watching him to see how a dog is going to try calling the cops when dogs aren't supposed to have thumbs; Fido gets as far as dialing the number, then he hangs up, crumpling in shame; &quot;Kill me. You've got a gun, right? So <I>shoot</I> me. I... almost took it. A-and you're right, that&#146;s not <I>me</I>, I'd be-- no, I don't wanna--&quot;; as he's sniveling on the tiles, the Joker steps up to him and pats him on the head, aims his gun... &quot;Y'know, pooch, you had one thing right about us humans.&quot;; he tosses the gun up in the air, then catches it, grinning down at Fido; &quot;We can be... just, <I>NGHH</I>. Real <I>bastards</I>, sometimes, can't we.&quot;; and he walks out, slamming the front door]<BR><BR>-----<BR><BR><B><I>100% FREAK!

He slumped one arm against the doorway, limping as he stepped out... mostly the fault of the stabwounds, which were already weeping the first of many thin, tic-tac-toe-shaped blots through to the outside of his trousers. But only mostly. <BR><BR>[words; girl's spitting blood into a cup of peroxide; Joker fishes the tongue stud out from his mouth and hands it to her: &quot;Think this is yours.&quot;; she grins at him, a gory serpent's line foaming down the tip of her tongue; somehow fitting, with her filed-down teeth gleaming sharklike around the edges of her mouth; she offers him the name of a clinic there in the Narrows that 'won't ask questions'; Joker merely turns around to face her, then puts a finger to his lips, drawing in small, silent gulps of air, like he's at a loss for words; finally just says, &quot;Let me give you my card.&quot;]<BR><BR>-----<BR><BR><B><I><U>I want you to watch me / J/O buddy / NOT GAY - m4m</U></I></B><I><BR>Good looking man here (I work out &amp; it shows), totally str8 but thinking bout this for a while. Be outside my patio (slide door) this Thurs night 9-11PM, I will be inside, I want another guy to watch while I jerk off. You can j/o too, do what you want while you are out there, but your staying outside, sorry LOL</I>.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR><I>Don't look at him</I>, Jeff repeated to himself. <I>If you don't look at him, maybe he'll go away</I>.<BR><BR>Outside, the pale guy with the lipstick began rapping on the glass patio door. Shave-and-a-hair-cut. Two-bits.<BR><BR><I>What kind of fag gets his hair dyed </I>green<I>, anyhow?</I> Jeff covered his face with his hands and sunk lower into his Laz-E-Boy, groaning. He knew he shouldn't have put that ad online. Only the <I>real</I> freaks hung out online. Everybody knew that.<BR><BR><I>PAMM PAMM PAMM PAMM PAMM</I>. The open-palm slams were loud enough to make Jeff jump in his chair. He turned to glare at the man outside, who waved back at him cheerfully. That special, super-prissy kind of wave, where your fingers twinkle around like they're triple-jointed.<BR><BR>Great. Nothing had even happened yet, and already he wanted to strangle this little wise-ass.<BR><BR><I>Wait, what's he got in his...?</I> Jeff squinted at the posterboard sign the guy outside had just held up. Big, scribbly black letters.<BR><BR>SAW YOUR AD. <BR><BR>And with that same shit-eating grin trained on Jeff the whole time, the guy's other hand trailed down to unzip the fly of his pants.<BR><BR>[Jeff figures, if begrudgingly, that it's ten-thirty already-- nobody else is going to be there, so he starts; guy outside does likewise, smearing clown white over his dick as his hand moves; watches Jeff come, then turns sign around: DID THE WALLS MOVE FOR YOU, TOO? --cue the explosives from the floor above, caving the ceiling down onto Jeff]<BR><BR>and bits of gravel-- no, <I>plaster</I>, hitting him like hail. Holy shit, the fucking <I>ceiling</I> was coming down! He looked up to see the fault lines splitting the pebbly white sky above him, heaving closer, too quickly for Jeff to do anything but repeat to himself how none of this should be happening.<BR><BR>The last thing he saw was a flicker of motion from outside. A thin burst, spurting out through the clown's clenched fist.<BR><BR>Jeff's face froze in a snarl, nostrils flared. <I>You BITCH! You fucking sick son of a</I>--<BR><BR>His brains collapsed onto his chest.<BR><BR>The Joker breathed out, smiling down at the splash of semen on the posterboard. He gave his cock another couple slow, easy pumps, milking the last few drops onto the sign.
