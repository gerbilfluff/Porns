Frank Palpatine.<BR><BR>I've got a bunch of names, being a senator most days and all. Sometimes, though, you've got to get away from the usual grind... and if there was ever a great city to get yourself lost in, Corsucant's the place.<BR><BR>So here I am. Boots kicked up on my desk. Office fan whirling like a drunken ballerina above me. Lollipop stick stiff in my mouth. Scowling from under my fedora like the job description demands. The whole nine yards of pure grit, that's me. Frank Palpatine, <I>private dick</I>.<BR><BR>Oh, yes... that reminds me. That snail I've got here in my hands is my sidekick, Wiggles. He's sound asleep, as usual, though right now I don't blame him. Today's been slower than a Gungan in trigonometry class. I pause from stroking him to give him a few rubs on his big pink shell, right where he likes it, seeing if I can't wake him up for some quality time between buddies...<BR><BR>Nothing. He doesn't even budge.<BR><BR>I'm wondering whether I should've put my name on the door or something when the knob turns and in walks Destiny. And damn, does Destiny have a fine ass.<BR><BR>The kid's about five foot twelve, all of it wrapped in beige, with a pout for the ages and a cloak so tight I can read the warning label on his lightsaber. &quot;Handle with care,&quot; indeed. Wiggles jerks his head up to take in the view, and again, I don't blame him.<BR><BR>&quot;Nice snail,&quot; the boy in beige says. &quot;Are you a dick?&quot;<BR><BR>I smile. &quot;If you're looking for one, I'm your man.&quot; I hold out a bowl. &quot;Lollipop?&quot;<BR><BR>He bats his eyelashes, scanning the candy dish like he's looking for its pulse. &quot;Do you have a cherry left?&quot;<BR><BR>I stumble around my head for an answer that won't get me slapped before giving up, plucking out a red one, and handing it to him. He takes it with a &quot;thanks&quot; that gives Wiggles the workout of his life, then purses his lips and takes in the thick tip of my sweet-pop just slowly enough to let my snail hit the finish line.<BR><BR>He stops, shooting me a confused look. &quot;Is that snail... <I>panting?</I>&quot; he asks through a mouthful of stick.<BR><BR>&quot;Don't mind Wiggles. He gets tired easily.&quot; I pat my sidekick on the head, then wipe away his slobbery trail of drool with my finger. &quot;But I should probably mention you're supposed to take the wrapper off first.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Oh,&quot; the kid says, and pulls the crinkle of plastic out from his mouth, wet and shiny with warm spittle.<BR><BR>I notice another gout of drool dribbling onto my pantleg as Wiggles shivers and faints dead away. Poor guy.<BR><BR>&quot;Well now, what's a Chosen One like you doing in a place like this?&quot; I ask my beige-covered guest.<BR><BR>He looks startled; his mane tussles around his head and neck like a flock of birds about to take off. &quot;How do you know who I am?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Easy. I see the newsprint headlines. And holo-vidcasts. The ads, too,&quot; I reach to fiddle with the blinds of the office window behind me. They swirl flat to reveal the kid's face on the billboard out back, winking and showing his traffic-stopping grin to the bottle of Yubba-Cola he's posed next to.<BR><BR>&quot;Oh. Yeah, that,&quot; he says, looking relieved.<BR><BR>I can't hide my smirk. &quot;And you need the help of a detective... <I>why?</I>&quot;<BR><BR>He doesn't notice the sarcasm, which is just as well, I suppose. &quot;I'm looking for somebody,&quot; he answers, back to being as serious as his angsty fashion-plate face can twist to look.<BR><BR>&quot;Wife run off on you?&quot;<BR><BR>A yelp dies in the kid's throat, his eyes bulging like a stuck nerf. &quot;Who told you I was married?!&quot; he stammers, then adds, &quot;Because, I mean... I'm <I>not!</I>&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Settle down, bright eyes. Just a simple guess, was all,&quot; I say. &quot;So who am I supposed to track down?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Huh? Oh. Oh, right. Um. His name is Kenobi. 'Ben' Kenobi.&quot;<BR><BR>I stop myself from shuddering at the name. That bearded blowhard was in here only last week. A Jedi with an oath of chastity he actually <I>keeps</I>... Talk about a killjoy. &quot;Ah, him. The one trying to chase down old 'No-Lungs' O'Grievous, right? He's got himself one nasty deathwish, that Ben.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I know. <I>I</I> should be the one who's out wherever he is,&quot; Beige-boy pouts, crossing both arms over his chest. &quot;I love him like a brother, but... I swear, it's like he's always holding me back! Like I'm just a kid!&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Well, my dear young man,&quot; I tell him, feeling my... er, <I>power</I> growing from the sound of his voice alone. &quot;If Kenobi's never around, you know there's still a fellow you can turn to in your, shall we say, times of need.&quot; My smirk's made its way into a full grin by now. I give Wiggles a tiny flick with my finger, trying to wake him up. This kid seems to need all the blatancy he can get in his come-ons.<BR><BR>My snail remains lost to the world.<BR><BR>&quot;...Eventually,&quot; I add, propping Wiggles up and waggling his head in a 'nod.'<BR><BR>My client's face lights up, slowly, starting to catch my drift. &quot;Then you'll take my case?&quot; he says, raising an eyebrow in a way he probably believes to be subtle.<BR><BR>&quot;Consider your case in my hands,&quot; I reply, smiling back. &quot;My very... <I>capable</I>... hands.&quot;<BR><BR>The kid nods. &quot;So we're gonna have <I>sex</I> now, is that what you mean?&quot;<BR><BR>Sigh. <BR><BR>I wave him towards my desk. &quot;Sure. C'mere.&quot;<BR><BR><BR>---fade to black---</P></BODY></HTML>
