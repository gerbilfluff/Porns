<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>Summary</u>: Temple Fugate solicits the services of a secretive prostitute who, according to many in the Rogue's Gallery, is able to make one's wildest fantasies come alive. As the Clock King soon discovers, his dreams of revenge can indeed be realized at last. There's a heavy cost involved, however: the deeper his curiosity runs, the farther he's dragged into "her" living nightmare.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>Author's Notes</u>: Poor Clock King. With all the infamous psychotics rampaging through the <i>Batman: Animated</i> universe, he's stuck being perceived as the lamest supervillain in the cast by most in the fandom, the laughingstock-- that one guy who doesn't really strike you as 'intimidating' as much as he does 'an anal-retentive British stereotype who happened to have been born in the USA instead.'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Fugate, here's your fifteen minutes, so to speak. Let me be the first to say "Congratulations."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Or "I'm so sorry. Please forgive me."</font></td>

Does that mean </i>you're<i> into that kind of stuff?</i>  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this fic proves, sometimes the answer's "Nah. Maybe a couple bits of a scenario. Mostly, not so much." Hell, nearly all the fics I've done for this series began as nothing more than brainstorming challenges, rooted in the same idea: What would this particular character find arousing?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answers don't always have to be obvious. Sure, the Clock King <i>could</i> have a carnal attraction to timepieces. Gotham City and its denizens aren't known for being subtle, after all. Dig a little deeper, however, and it seems Temple Fugate's obsession with clocks might only be the most efficient means to an end his efficiency-crazed brain could find. Above all, he prizes organization; in its basest sense, organization equals control. Control the time, and you control people's actions-- you control <i>everything</i>. For a mind like that, domineering tendencies would be a cozy match, don't you think?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same with Two-Face, here. I may not consider much in this fic to be  all that sexy (well... at least, not the guy/girl concept, heh), but when the first plot-point nubbins started snaking out from its <i>what WOULD he be into?</i> origins, it didn't take long for me to realize Harvey Dent's dark side probably had tastes most people would feel dirty just thinking about. And really, as the personification of every ugly thought to cross an upper-class do-gooder's pent-up imagination, why wouldn't Big Bad Harv find raw, unapologetic filthiness to be a turn-on?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifting gears, I'd like to take a moment to thank the writing team of the recently-deceased <i>Batman Adventures</i> comic book series. Bear with me; this is related. It has nothing to do with sex. It has <i>everything</i> to do with making magic from a cancelled cartoon show's canon remains. I had the good fortune to discover the paperback volumes of this unsung gem midway through writing <i>Caution: Plays Well With Others</i>, and when it comes to this team's talent for penning characters as both in-character <i>and</i> grippingly, genuinely fun to read, I can only hope I've grazed the surface of their level.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I realize it might not be the most orthodox of homages to offer a respected party, this fanfic is dedicated to the <i>Batman Adventures</i> crew. It's like a <u>Choose Your Own Adventure</u> novel from the Eighties. Only with hookers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...It was either this story, the Riddler word-puzzles-lead-you-to-his-secret-gloryhole idea, or the one about Victor Fries's guilt-ridden battle with his own necrophilia, so count your blessings, guys.</font></font></tr></td>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>Summary</u>: Behind the scenes of the episode "Read My Lips," as seen by one of Scarface's goons. Ratso always knew Gotham City was a freaky place, but even he isn't prepared for what goes on when the Ventriloquist gets some time away from his puppet.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>Author's Notes</u>: There had to be <i>some</i> reason why Rhino and Mugsy show up in almost every Ventriloquist episode, while Ratso disappears after the gang's first run, eh?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, for anyone wondering why the Ventriloquist is a semi-closeted gay man in this story when I've previously only written him as a doll fetishist: there was never meant to be overlying continuity between any of these fics. I'm just having fun with what sprouts from "Yeah, but WHAT IF..."</font></td>
